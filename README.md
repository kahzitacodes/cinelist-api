# CineList Project

This was the second project made for IronHack's Web Development Bootcamp and developed using ReactJS, Node, Express and MongoDB.

CineList is a web application for people to create lists with their favorite movies. The lists are placed at the homepage, so other people can see it.

Each list has a title and a description., and along with it the user can search for movies in The Movie Database API and add to the list. It't also possible to edit and delete a list.

The app is responsive and adjust for different screens.
