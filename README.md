# CineList Project

This was the second project made for IronHack's Web Development Bootcamp.

We use ReactJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Axios.

CineList is a React app for people to create lists with their favorite movies. The lists are placed on the homepage, so other people can see it. 

Each list has a name and a description and the user can search for movies in The Movie Database API to add to the list. It't also posible to edit and delete a list.

The app is responsive and adjust for different screens.
